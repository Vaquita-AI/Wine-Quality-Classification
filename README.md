# Wine Quality Prediction Project

## Overview
This project aims to predict the quality of wine based on various physicochemical properties. It utilizes machine learning algorithms and deep learning models to analyze the wine quality dataset and predict the quality score.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the `Wine Quality Dataset`. It contains different features that describe the physicochemical properties of wine and a quality score for each wine sample.

## Dependencies
To run the code in this project, you need to have the following libraries installed:
- TensorFlow
- Keras Tuner
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Imbalanced-learn

You can install these packages using `pip`:
```
pip install tensorflow keras-tuner pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn imbalanced-learn
```

## Modules
The project is structured into different modules as follows:

### 1. Importing the necessary Modules
All the necessary Python modules are imported, including TensorFlow, Keras Tuner, and various Scikit-learn classes for model selection, preprocessing, and metrics.

### 2. Data Exploration
The dataset is read and explored to understand the distribution of different features and the target variable. This includes generating descriptive statistics and visualizing correlations using heatmaps.

### 3. Data Preprocessing
The dataset is preprocessed which includes splitting the data into training and test sets, standardizing the features, and handling class imbalance using SMOTE.

### 4. Model Building
Several machine learning models including Support Vector Classifier (SVC), Random Forest Classifier (RFC), and Logistic Regression are used. Additionally, a neural network model is constructed using TensorFlow's Sequential API with Dense layers and a softmax activation function for the output layer.

### 5. Model Compilation
The neural network model is compiled with the Adam optimizer and sparse categorical crossentropy as the loss function.

### 6. Model Training
The models are trained on the training data. For the neural network, early stopping is used as a callback to prevent overfitting.

### 7. Model Evaluation
The models are evaluated using the test set. Metrics such as accuracy, F1 scores, and confusion matrices are used to assess the performance of the models.

## Usage
To run the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure all dependencies are installed.
3. Run the Jupyter notebooks or Python scripts provided in the repository.

## Results
The accuracy and other metrics of the models are printed out during the evaluation phase. For detailed results, refer to the output of the evaluation code blocks in the Jupyter notebooks.
